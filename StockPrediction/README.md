# Stock Prices Estimation
Predicting Stock Prices using Kaggle Dataset
# About the Project
1. The project uses the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs">Kaggle Stock Market Dataset</a>
2. We use one file from the dataset called <a href="https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/Miscellaneous-Deep-Learning-Projects/blob/master/StockPrediction/aadr.us.txt">aadr.us.txt</a>
3. To use the model, you can either train the model with your own hyperparameters and tweak it OR you can use the pretrained model
4. This is how the model's predictions turn out after 250-300 epochs, after which the model just seems to not learn and eventually diverges a bit after the 500th epoch
